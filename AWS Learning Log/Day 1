Static Website Hosting with Amazon S3 and Amazon CloudFront

This project is a simple static website hosted on **Amazon S3** and distributed globally using **Amazon CloudFront**.  
It demonstrates how CloudFront improves speed and reliability for content delivery by caching files at edge locations closer to the user.

# Learning Objectives
- Understand how **Amazon S3** can host static website files.
- Learn how **Amazon CloudFront** works as a Content Delivery Network (CDN).
- Explore how S3 and CloudFront integrate to deliver content efficiently.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# What I Did
1. **Created an S3 Bucket**
   - Enabled static website hosting.
   - Uploaded `cloud_front.html`.
   - Made the file publicly accessible.

2. **Set Up a CloudFront Distribution**
   - Configured the S3 bucket as the origin.
   - Set the **Default Root Object** to `cloud_front.html` for cleaner URLs.
   - Deployed the distribution and tested using the domain name.

3. **Tested Access**
   - Verified the distribution domain loads the static site.
   - Noted that without the **Default Root Object**, the file name must be appended in the URL.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# What I Learned
- **S3 as the Origin**
  - Stores static files (HTML, CSS, JS, images).
  - Requires static website hosting to serve files over HTTP.
  - Files must have correct permissions for CloudFront access.

- **CloudFront as the CDN**
  - Distributes content from global edge locations.
  - Caches files for faster load times.
  - The distribution domain acts as the public URL.

- **Integration Workflow**
  1. User requests the site via the CloudFront domain.
  2. CloudFront fetches the file from the S3 bucket (origin).
  3. CloudFront caches the file at the nearest edge location for future requests.
